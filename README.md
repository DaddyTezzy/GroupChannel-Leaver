# GroupChannel Leaver
- Leaves all groupchannels/groupchats the user is in.
- Does not clears all direct messages, but only groupchannels.

## INSTALLING/SELFHOSTING
- Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
- Make sure you have [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) version that is below 2.0.0 as user tokens are not proper in the latest versions anymore sadly.
- Put your [token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI) in `config.json` line: 2.
- Run `launch.bat` and you should be good to go!

## LEGALITY
- Yes this is considered as selfbot (anything you do with your token that involves scripts; is considered as selfbotting).
- However, this is just for educational purposes and was made for users that may get groupchannel spammed as it is very common nowadays for some weird reason.
- I made this script in a minute or two for a friend that got their account spammed with groupchannels and they asked me to upload the script here so here it is!
- If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to message me on Discord!
- Enjoy ðŸ’«
